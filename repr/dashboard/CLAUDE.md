## UI Concept: An Intimate Look Into an Inventor's Journal

The dashboard should feel like peeking into someone's private workshop notebook - the raw, unpolished thinking behind creation. Not a changelog, not a social feed. A journal.

### Core Principle

Capture the *texture* of building:
- The moment something broke
- The rabbit hole that followed
- The half-idea that turned out to be the answer
- The quiet satisfaction of a fix that just worked

This is the story behind the commit, not the commit message.

### Visual Direction

**The feeling of a private notebook, not a public feed:**

| Avoid (Corporate/Social) | Embrace (Journal) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Cards, borders, containers | Open space, breathing room |
| Badges, labels, metadata-heavy | Quiet timestamps, inline context |
| "Announcement" energy | "Thinking out loud" energy |
| Polished, formatted | Raw, in-progress |

**Header:**
- Minimal - almost invisible
- Just enough to orient: what project, what's happening now
- Could hint at active work: "thinking..." or a subtle pulse

**Entry layout:**
- Time in the margin like a handwritten date
- Text flows like prose, not structured data
- Technical details (files, diffs) recede until needed
- No likes, shares, menus - this isn't for an audience

**Typography:**
- Monospace but warm - the font of a personal terminal
- Even weight, no shouting headers
- Let the words carry the meaning

**Rhythm:**
- Entries breathe - not crammed together
- Related thoughts can cluster
- Silence (empty space) is part of the story

### Inspection (on-demand)

The diff viewer and file details stay available - just not front-and-center:
- Click/tap an entry to expand details
- Diff modal remains unchanged
- File list collapses by default, expands on interaction
- Stats (+12/-3) visible but subtle, clickable to open diff

Goal: clean reading flow by default, full inspection when needed.

### Example Entry

```
10:42    Something felt off about the redirect. Tokens showing up
         where they shouldn't. Spent an hour tracing it back -
         turned out the session handler never cleaned up on logout.

         One of those bugs that makes you wonder how it ever worked.

         +12 -3 · 2 files
```

The stats line is quiet, clickable. The diff is there when you want it.

vs the old social-media style:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ (R)  project-name  [FEATURE]  · 2h      │
│                                         │
│ **Fix auth token leak**                 │
│ Added cleanup to session handler...     │
│                                         │
│ View diff (+12/-3)                      │
│ ┌─ Files changed (2) ─────────────┐     │
│ │ auth/session.py                 │     │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The difference: one reads like a person thinking, the other like a system reporting.

### Implementation Notes

- Most of the change is CSS/layout - structure can stay similar
- Content quality depends on extraction prompts (separate concern)
- Consider dark mode as default (more "terminal" feel)
- Mobile: single column works, timestamp could go above entry
